WeatherPy Observations

1. Latitude has an impact on temperature. As hypothesized, cities closer to 0 (the equator) and further from the poles are higher in temperature. 
It is interesting to note that the apex of the Max Temps observed on 12/18/2019 is not at 0. Instead it is slightly further south. 
This is most likely due to the southern hemisphere currently in its summer months. 
It is also noted that the hottest cities observered were all located in AU, indicating a potential "heat wave" of some sort in the region.

2. There does not appear to be any generalized impact of localization on Humidity, by either Latitude, Longitude, or Country.
It is noted however, that the areas with the lowest humidity are found to be the locations with the highest Max Temperatures, located in Australiat.
There are some "holes" of localization. For example, cities within with Lng ~-150 appear to have a less diverse humidity level than those at 150.
This is most likely observable due to the hot temperatures and lot humidity in Australia.

3. There does not appear to be any generalized impact of localization on Cloudiness, by either Latitude, Longitude, or Country.
It is interesting to note that it seems that there is clustering of cloudiness at opposite ends of the spectrum. 
By this, I mean that cities tend to be either completely cloudy, or not at all.

4. We can observe on some of our charts that there appears to be very few cities at Longitude -25.
On the "Longitude vs. Wind Speed" chart, this is very apparent, as there seems to be a gap.
By looking on a map, this makes sense, as the -20 line runs through the atlantic ocean and intersects almost no land, excluding parts of Greenland and Antartica.
The same can be observed for Latitude values less than -60. As these regions tend to inhabit no land, or are uninhabited (Antartica).
