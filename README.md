# Worldly-Weather
--- 
This repository houses analytics for real-time, weather data sourced from Open Weather Map (https://github.com/ARMcK-hub/Worldly-Weather).

Observations from the analysis can be viewed in the Observations.txt file; visualizations are both within the Worldly-Weather.ipynb file and the Outputs directory.

The primary goal of this analysis is to prove some thing that may seem obvious: it's hotter at the equator. 

There are also some interesting finds in this data; however, most notably, this analysis was completed during the EOY 2019, when Austrialia was experiencing one of the worst heats ever.
This is directly apparent during the observation.
